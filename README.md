# Notes on how to successfully run everything

es6 introduced let and const.  because var isn't that good handling memory etc

It is better to run node via nvm instead of installing it from the website.
Once we run it, type the word "node" in the terminal, it acts like a consolelog of everything.
.exit to get out of node
Typing touch main.js, will create a file called main.js in whichever folder we are in.
   Type in whatever javascript code you want to run, like create a function, and call it etc.. 
   Then go into node and type in node main.js, will run the file for you.

Since we don't have a <script></script> tag since we are not using the browser, like es2015, we are using node, so we have Common.js modules, which Node.js automatically supports.  
Common.js module/s syntax, makes use of the require, module, and exports keywords. In Common.js, every JavaScript file is a module. 
Core node modules are fs, path, and process
